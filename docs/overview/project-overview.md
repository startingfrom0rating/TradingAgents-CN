# TradingAgents Project Overview

## Introduction

TradingAgents-CN is a multi-agent large language model (LLM) based financial analysis and decision framework. Originally enhanced for Chinese users (A-share support, domestic LLMs, Docker deployment, structured professional report export), this repository now presents English translations in-place per migration request.

The system simulates a real trading organization by orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate to evaluate market conditions and generate investment decisions.

## Background

### Motivation
Traditional algorithmic systems rely on a single model or narrow strategy—fragile in dynamic markets. Real trading desks distribute reasoning across specialists: fundamental analysts, technical strategists, macro/news interpreters, sentiment evaluators, traders, and risk managers.

The core idea: Digitize this human expert team dynamic via coordinated autonomous LLM agents.

### Technical Innovations
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Coordinated autonomous roles for finance
- **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on one analytical dimension
- **Structured Debate**: Bull vs bear research confrontation improves signal quality
- **Dynamic Risk Management**: Continuous scoring & adjustment

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Market Analysis
- **Fundamental Analysis**: Financial statement & valuation factor synthesis
- **Technical Analysis**: Trend, momentum, structure & signal extraction
- **News Analysis**: Event & macro narrative interpretation
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Social / contextual mood inference

### 2. Agent Collaboration Mechanics
- **Parallel Processing** to reduce latency
- **Structured Debate** (bull vs bear research agents)
- **Consensus Formation** via reasoning synthesis
- **Layered Risk Evaluation** & mitigation hints

### 3. Flexible Architecture
- **Modular Components** extensible via adapters
- **Multi-LLM Support**: DashScope (Qwen), Google AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek
- **Unified Configuration** through environment toggles
- **Graceful Degradation** falling back to file caches if DB unavailable

### 4. Rich Data Integrations
- **A-share Data**: Tushare (real-time + historical) ✅
- **US Equities**: FinnHub, Yahoo Finance ✅
- **News Sources**: Google News + finance feeds ✅
- **Sentiment**: Reddit sampling ✅
- **Persistence Layer**: MongoDB + Redis + intelligent caching ✅

### 5. Modern Web Interface (since v0.1.2)
- **Streamlit Dashboard** for orchestration
- **Real-Time Progress** visualization
- **Config Management**: API keys, LLM selection, depth
- **Token/Cost Tracking** instrumentation
- **Responsive Layout** (desktop & mobile)
